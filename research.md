I work primarily on computational nuclear astrophysics. My research interests include <b>compact objects</b>, astrophysical sources of <b>gravitational waves</b>, and <b>core-collape supernovae</b> with emphasis on progenitor evolution, explosion, and nucleosynthesis. Below I will talk about some of my past and future efforts in these different interests. A complete list of my scientific publications can be found <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l41AVWQAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>. For more information,

<i>3D volume rendering of a massive star moments before iron core-collapse.</i>
<br>
<br>
In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04266">Fields & Couch (2020)</a>,
we investigated the three-dimensional evolution of a 15 solar mass star for the final seven minutes up to and including iron core-collapse. In this work we found that 1D models of massive stars may estimate convective speeds by a factor of four less than our 3D models suggest. These results have crucial implications for models of core-collapse supernova explosions.
