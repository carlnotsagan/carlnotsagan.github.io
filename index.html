<p>
	I am an Astronomy & Astrophysics Ph.D. student at Michigan State University studying computational/theoretical astrophysics.
<br>  
	My graduate advisor is Prof. Sean Couch and my current/past collaborators include: Prof. Frank Timmes (ASU),
        Dr. Robert Farmer (ASU), Dr. Ilka Petermann (ASU), and Prof. Christian Iliadis (UNC).
        My work primarily focuses on computational modeling of massive star supernova progenitor
        evolution, explosion, and nucleosynthesis.
